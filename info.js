    // "A second year Computer Science graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington with an interest in Software Development, UX Design and Artificial Intelligence - and seeking exciting opportunities related to the same.<br><br>I am a detail oriented person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity. I would bring to table a wide range of software skills, ranging from design and development to writing scripts for intelligent agents. I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic environment and competitive university life define me, and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.

    "Hi everyone, I'm Srikar. I am an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Applied Math. I love learning anything about databases, machine learning, and neat algorithms. Currently, I am in my final year taking numerical analysis, deep neural nets, computer vision and complex analysis. <br><br> Professionally, I’ve worked for Talroo as a machine learning engineer, where I designed complex ml models to understand, classify, and match job descriptions with related skills. I’ve also worked at Vogue magazine at the World Trade Center, as a data platform engineer, where I built out robust enterprise-level data pipelines and highly-scalable micro services. <br><br> Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing pickleball and exploring new spots. I like making friends so please reach out if you'd like to hang out! :)",
